Our love of Tunisian cuisine is our reason for this blog!

We're one of those fortunate couples who somehow managed to be born thousands of miles apart, yet fate crossed our paths and we have been blessed with the kind of love one can only hope for in this life. I'm born and raised in California, and his life's journey began in Tunisia. Our life in Southern California is typical beach living, until you step into our kitchen. Open the spice cabinet and you'll see my ongoing attemps at organizing a broad range of exotic spices. Our refrigerator often has fresh Loup de Mer, Merguez sausage and always a nice stash of harissa. And we don't limit our cooking to North African cuisine, it just tends to be the starting point for all of our culinary adventures. B'neen means tasty in Tunisian, and I chose that as our business name, maybe because it was one of the first Tunisian words I learned. It is easy to say, and it is even easier to understand whoever uses the word, as they sit down to a fantastic meal and taste that first magical bite.

We look forward to sharing our love for Tunisian cuisine here with you.
